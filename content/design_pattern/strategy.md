## Strategy 
*When:* There are many products (ProductA, ProductB, ...) which are derived classes of Product.
Client doesn't care about concrete products. 


```c++

```

## State
**Same Class Diagram** with Strategy but with different **intent**

```c++
```

## Policy-based design
** compile-tiem variant of the strategy pattern**
- policies are bound at compile time, but strategies are bound to run time.
